  <h2>some old projects</h2>
  <h3>beathouse</h3>
  <p> name was gross, renamed it to soundbound. it's a code ive been working on or have already rewrote
 its a music app that uses an xbox controller to play music<p>
  <h3>image comparer<h3>
   <p>this project was not meant to be anything really good. i just wanted to
    learn how to work with images in python. I made it in a day or 2
    it just takes two images and checks all the pixels. if they arent the same then they will be highlighted bright red
    (255,0,0 for you rgb nerds)</p>
   <h3>memebot</h3>
   <p>this was a discord bot i made when i was 11. i more recently started to make a updating script in python 
    that would check a repo for the newest branches and figure out what the newest version is and update if needed</p>
  <h2>some of my codes you can try</h2>
   <h3>image comparer</h3>
   <p>should be a pinned repo. image comparer does exactly what it says in the name,
    compares images. it will highlight the differences in two images red</p>
