 <p>Sophmore in high school.</p>
<h2>coding languages</h2>
  <p>mainly program python and java, sometimes i do some cpp or javascript</p>
  <h2> current projects</h2>
   basically redeveloping the app my boss uses for scheduling and other misc stuff because it annoyed me so much I had to prove to myself that I could do better

  <h3>image comparer<h3>
   <p>this project was not meant to be anything really good. i just wanted to
    learn how to work with images in python. I made it in a day or two
    it just takes two images and checks all the pixels. if they arent the same then they will be highlighted bright red</p>
  
   <h2>>other misc stuff</h2>
  <p>big fan of deftones, and mountain dew</p>
  <p>been using linux and programming python since I was 7, i was learning how to configure wine in 2017 in order to run roblox studio on my old macbook with ubuntu back then</p>
  <p>currently using arch linux with gnome, and I dont care that you think it isnt the most customizable, I do most of my work through the terminal anyways.</p>
  <p>kinda wasted a lot of my talent early on, havent done much coding since I was a 7th grader, and im a 10th grader now, barely know python, know a small ammount of java, and if I could write a small cpp class if my life depended on it</p>
